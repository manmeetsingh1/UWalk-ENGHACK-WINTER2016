##UWalk
UWalk is an app that tracks your daily commute and displays real-time data from your journey onto a web dashboard. Some of this data includes a map which plots your total journey, daily steps taken and other data taken from Androidâ€™s various sensors. This was a project created at UWaterloo's [ENGHACK](http://eng-math-hack.devpost.com/). The website is up and running as a Heroku app [here](http://uwalk.herokuapp.com/). Below are some screenshots:
